This matlab function is generated and tested in MATLAB 2022, and 2024

Please open datagen.m script and run it with MATLAB to generate synthetic dataset with same configuration as CMuSeNet synthetic dataset.

In this script you can change various setting such as channel (AWGN, Rician, Rayleigh), sample speed, range of SNR and sample bandwidth.

This dataset is used to train CMuSeNet, complex-valued multi-signla segmentation Network.

Please cite our paper if you use this dataset or synthetic dataset generation script.
